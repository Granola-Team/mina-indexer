## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Flox](https://flox.dev/docs/install-flox/) - this will also install Nix for you.

If you have previously installed Nix, you may need to uninstall it first:

   - [The Determinate Nix Uninstaller](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer#uninstalling)
   - [Standard Nix uninstall process](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.24/installation/uninstall)

### Development

You must first enter the Flox environment by using `flox activate`.

Running any [`rake`](Rakefile) task will automatically enter the Flox environment.

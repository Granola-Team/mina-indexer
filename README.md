# mina-indexer

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Install Flox](https://flox.dev/docs/install-flox/)
  - This will install Nix for you
  - If you have previously installed Nix using [The Determinate Nix Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer#the-determinate-nix-installer), you may need to use [the uninstaller](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer#uninstalling) before installing Flox.

### Development

You must first enter the Flox environment by using `flox activate`.

Running any [`rake`](Rakefile) task will automatically enter the Flox environment.

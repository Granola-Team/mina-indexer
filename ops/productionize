# 2. The filesystem name of a socket to use for comms, $SOCKET.
# 3. A directory from which to read the blocks.
# 4. A directory from which to read the staking ledgers.
# 5. A directory that contains the "$SRC"/data directory for initialization.
# 6. A directory in which to store the database.
# 7. A directory in which to store the logs.

# 1. This is the directory that we intend to configure for production use.
#

# for the shutdown command, note.

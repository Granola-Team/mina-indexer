# 1. A directory to store files related to the mina-indexer, $PROD.
# 2. A directory in which to store the logs, $LOGS.
# 3. A directory from which to read the blocks.
# 4. A directory from which to read the staking ledgers.
# 5. The filesystem name of a socket to use for comms, $SOCKET.
# 6. A directory in which to store the database.

# granola-mina-blocks Linode bucket if need be. Note that the prior production
